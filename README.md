# Real Time Bus Tracker
This is an example using real data of the positions of the [MBTA](https://mbta.com/) buses in boston, showing their location and tracking in real time. It also leaves a trace of the route of each bus.

## Future Improvements
I had some problems updating the information on the map, I had to study the [MapBox](https://docs.mapbox.com/) documentation and look for examples to fix it. Some improvements that I will make later will be:
* Add a legend of the available buses and their routes.
* Add a bus and route search engine, or even close to you.
* Swap markers for 3D bus icons to see the direction it is traveling.
